# IRC
The Scholars' Lab R&D group can regularly be found on its [IRC][4] channel
hosted by Freenode ([freenode.net][5]). This is a great way to ask a quick
question or be part of other conversations. There are a lot of clients
out there to choose from, and for brevity's sake, we'll limiting this to
a Windows, a Mac, and a web client.

## Web Client

installing any software. Simply choose a nickname for yourself, and 
connect to the '**#slab**' channel.
