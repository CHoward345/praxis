# So You Want A Website...

## Some things to consider:

There are several things to consider when creating and publishing your website.
Just a few:

* What kind of content, and how much?
* What is your timeline for your project?
* Who is your intended audience?
* Are there any technical restrictions or incompatabilities?
* Do you have the technical skills you need, or know how to acquire
them?(hint-Scholars' Lab, your librarian, web resources such as
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), or the [Hard Way series](http://learncodethehardway.org/)...)


## Hosting

Once you have your content (and skills) in place, you'll need a place to put
your awesome site. A few, (not complete!), are listed below:

* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* [heroku](https://heroku.com)
* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com)
* [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com)
* [Linode](https://www.linode.com)
* [appfog](https://www.appfog.com)
* [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

## DNS

When you host your own site, you will want a custom domain name for your site.
[Hover](https://www.hover.com) is a good **D**omain **N**ame **S**ervice that
lets you point a URL (e.g. `scholarslab.org`) at a server address (e.g.
`67.23.31.99`). There are others-check a few out to compare.
