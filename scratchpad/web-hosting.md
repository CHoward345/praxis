<h1>So You Want A Website...</h1>

<h2>Some things to consider:</h2>
<p>There are several things to consider
when creating and publishing your website. Just a few:
<ul>
<li>What kind of content, and how much?</li>
<li>What is your timeline for your project?</li>
<li>Who is your intended audience?</li>
<li>Are there any technical restrictions or incompatabilities?</li>
<li>Do you have the technical skills you need, or know how to acquire
them?(hint-Scholars' Lab, your librarian, web resources such as
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>, or the <a href="http://learncodethehardway.org/">Hard Way series</a>...)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>
Once you have your content (and skills) in place, you'll need a place to
put your awesome site. A few, not complete!, are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.openshift.com">Openshift</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linode.com">Linode</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.appfog.com">aapfog, recently purchased by century link</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When you host your own site, you will want to control the url.
<a href="https://www.hover.com">Hover</a> is one domain management
service. There are others-check a few out to compare.</p>
