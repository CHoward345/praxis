Project-Specific Units
Spyros - has done some circuits and printing - and Christian - mostly done printing - / Paula - textiles.
1. Intro to makerspace
2. Critical Making pt. 1 (Could use the Maker-Centered learning exercises Ammon learned in his Harvard Online class)
3. 3D Printing (two sessions) - instruct them on the printer in 30 minutes. schedule two hours outside at least. - would just need to slice up the prints w/ the software. TinkerCad for 3d modeling for doing their own prints. Cura sp? Ultimaker - Makerbot uses something else. Formlab uses its own program - preform. probably imagining printing what others have done. Modeling their own things - very time consuming.
4. 3D Printing (two sessions).  actual printing takes longer outside sessions.
5. Critical Making pt. 2.
5. Wearables - Paula Archey - good for textiles - (two sessions - no programming involved). circuit glove - but can come up with something else.
6. Wearables - pt. 2 - having it first allows them to see the circuit aspect before they get through the programming aspects. might require the most prep. wearables around holidays
6. Circuits/Arduinos (two sessions - probably have them work in pairs) - working through the SIK Guide
7. Circuits/Arduinos (two sessions) - programming concepts.
