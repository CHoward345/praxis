# Praxis Program Charter

The [Praxis Program Charter 2017-2018](/charter/charter-2017-2018) aims to outline core and shared values of the Praxis Fellows. It represents both a set of working practices and a way of navigating future outcomes based on the work of the fellowship.

Our [Towards a Project Charter](/resources/toward-a-project-charter/) page provides resources that have grounded our discussions and creation of the Praxis Charters.

And the <a href="http://scholarslab.org/about/charter/">charter</a> put together by the Scholars' Lab itself in 2014 outlines many of our shared values and what we see as our mission.
