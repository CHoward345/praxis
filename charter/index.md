# Praxis Program Charter

The Praxis Program Charter aims to outline core and shared values of the Praxis Fellows. It represents both a set of working practices and a way of navigating future outcomes based on the work of the fellowship.

Our [Towards a Project Charter](/scratchpad/toward-a-project-charter/) provides resources that have grounded our discussions and creation of the Praxis Charter.
