# About Praxis

The Praxis Program is a project of the [Scholars'
Lab](http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab) at the [University of Virginia
Library](http://lib.virginia.edu/). In its first two pilot years
(2011-2013), it is generously funded by a grant from the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation to the [Scholarly Communication
Institute](http://uvasci.org).

Praxis is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer
in the Scholars' Lab, and is is meant to complement our work with [Graduate
Fellows in Digital
Humanities](http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/about/fellowship.html), a
program shortly entering its sixth year at UVa Library.

The Praxis Program funds a team of six University of Virginia graduate students from
a variety of disciplines to apprentice with us each academic year. Under
the guidance of Scholars' Lab faculty and staff, they are designing and building [*Prism*](http://prism.scholarslab.org), a new tool for "crowd-sourcing" textual analysis,
visualization, and humanities interpretation.

But *Prism* is not the goal.

[Recognizing](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/it-starts-on-day-one/37893) that up-to-date methodological training is often absent or
catch-as-catch-can for humanities graduate students, we are using these two pilot
years of the Praxis Program to experiment with an action-oriented curriculum
*live and in public.* 

We hope to attract partners in labs and centers at other
institutions as well as local supporters, and to situate our contribution in a
larger conversation about the changing demands of the humanities in a digital
age. To that end, and with the support of the Scholarly Communication
Institute, we are forging an international *Praxis Network,* of model
programs taking different approaches to the problem of methodological
training in the humanities.

The Praxis Program aims to equip knowledge workers for emerging faculty
positions and [alternative academic
careers](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac) at a moment in which
new questions can be asked and new systems built. We share our evolving
curriculum and our staff and students alike are [blogging about their
experience](http://www.scholarslab.org/category/praxisprogram/).

We invite you to follow our work together (always in progress), as we see what it takes to produce
thoughtful digital humanities scholars &mdash; scholars comfortable designing effective user
experiences, writing and working with open source code, engaging broad
audiences, managing teams and budgets, and theorizing their work within the
rich tradition of humanities computing.
