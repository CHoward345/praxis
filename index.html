  <p>The Praxis Program reimagines graduate methodological training for the demands of the humanities in the digital age.</p>

  <p>Our goal is to equip knowledge workers for positions within and beyond the academy at a moment in which new questions can be asked and new systems built. The Praxis Program produces humanities scholars who can reach new audiences and are as comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets.</p>
