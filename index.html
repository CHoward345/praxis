    <h1>Time</h1>
    <p>Praxis is experimenting with time&mdash;rather, how to represent time physically and digitally. We are in the process now of narrowing down our methodologies and case studies</p>

    <h1>Time tracking and java script</h1>
    <p>What are we working on? This week we are starting to learn java script. We are also keeping track of our time--reflecting on the ways that we experience, value and structure our time individually in our daily lives. We will be experimenting with this--trying out different means of tracking our time and comparing amongst ourselves in the next few weeks. Stay tuned!

    <p>The Praxis Program reimagines graduate methodological training for the demands of the humanities in the digital age.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to equip knowledge workers for positions within and beyond the academy at a moment in which new questions can be asked and new systems built. The Praxis Program produces humanities scholars who can reach new audiences and are as comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets.</p>
