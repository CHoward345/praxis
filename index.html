    <h1>Time</h1>
    <p>Praxis is experimenting with time&mdash;rather, how to represent time physically and digitally. We are sharing blog posts, rough notes, and sketches.</p>

    <h1>Inktober!</h1>
    <p>This month we are pushing ourselves to participate in <a href="http://mrjakeparker.com/inktober">Jake Parker's Inktober</a> by making daily sketches that represent time in non-linear ways. You should be able to see some of these <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/time/">here.</a> We are also continuing to work on our case studies of time, which are surely informing the sketches we draw.</p>

    <p>The Praxis Program reimagines graduate methodological training for the demands of the humanities in the digital age.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to equip knowledge workers for positions within and beyond the academy at a moment in which new questions can be asked and new systems built. The Praxis Program produces humanities scholars who can reach new audiences and are as comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets.</p>
