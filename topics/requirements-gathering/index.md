# Requirements Gathering

We'll begin discussing the scope and feature set of the Prism project.

* Functional requirements: What features will it have? How might it work?
* Audience: Who are our target users? How would this tool help them or impact their work?
* Process: What tools, languages, and processes will we use to build it?

## Peer work

* David McClure's [Public Poetics](http://publicpoetics.org) project.
