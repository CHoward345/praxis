# Requirements Gathering

We'll begin discussing the requirements and [scope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(project_management) for Prism.

* Functional requirements: What features will it have? How might it work?
* Audience: Who are our target users? How would this tool help them or impact their work?
* Process: What tools, languages, and strategy will we use to build it? Dealing with [scope creep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep)

## Peer work

* David McClure's [Public Poetics](http://publicpoetics.org) project.
