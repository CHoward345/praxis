I don't want to disappoint the curious reader coming to this page
seeking enlightenment, but I don't know the rules for writing in the
genre of the bio. In the spirit of the readers of the Earl of
Shaftesbury, who writes about the nature of prefaces as a preface to
his [*Characteristics*](http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/1851),
forgive me for thinking through the genre as an answer.

## What is a "bio" and what role does it have? ##

It seems to be a shortening of biography, a literary form drawing on
the hagiography, but made sleek for a bright internet future. The
[OED](http://www.oed.com/) tells us that the word appears as early as
1925, but in all three quotes it is a biography written by one person
about
another. [Google Ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=bio&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3)
seems to agree that the word takes-off between 1900 and 1920. In the
context of journalism, it seems to suggest something *short*, which an
abbreviation of a perfectly sensible English word into three letters
also points at. So, it seems that bios are short.

## Whence does the self-written bio come from? ##

There's no obvious souce that I know of, but looking through the
[Corpus of American English](http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/
), which covers 450 million words from
1990-2012, I note that "[app*] bio"&mdash;that is a possessive and the word
"bio"&mdash;occurs eighty times: twenty-three times as "your bio,"
forty-three times as "his" or "her" bio, nine times as "my" bio,
thrice as "their" bio, and twice as our bio. The bios seem to be read
before an interview, posted to LinkedIn, or fabricated by other people
before being commented on. It seems that the bio stands-in for some
other kind of connection an invitation to ignorance. Being asked to
write a bio seems to invite a sort of self-erasure, a distancing of
the experience of a person. I cannot help but
think of the scene from Annie Hall:

[![ANNIE HALL](http://img.youtube.com/vi/9wWUc8BZgWE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wWUc8BZgWE
"Annie Hall (1977) scene with Marshall McLuhan")

So, can we say that writing a bio is an invitation to provide a
journalistic snapshot? Does a hyper-linked periphrasis then resist
summaries or is it simply an annoying abuse of systems? As the
gracious reader can make this bio as short as they'd like, I'll assume
that I cannot possibly be abusing your attention, nor can I force you
to participate in my digressions.
