Hello all - three more images for Inktober.

The first is a continuation from [my previous Inktober post](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/blog/2015/10/05/inktober-10-5-three-sketches/), very simply, two tubes of toothpaste, both almost empty.

Was still thinking of the consumption of objects, for two reasons: first, because of their importance to Karl Marx, a thinker deeply interested in time, everything from [the length of the working day](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm) to [labour-time itself here in the first chapter of *Capital*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#S1), and second, because a lot of people use toothpaste in their everyday life. It is something they consume very slowly; they mark their days with its consumption.

To start with Marx though, in the first chapter of *Capital* (titled: Commodities) he defines the value of a commodity as "the labour time socially necessary for its production." He then goes on to quote himself from the [Economic & Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/preface.htm) saying that "As exchange values, all commodities are merely definite quantities of *congealed labour-time*."

What a phrase! *Congealed labour-time*. As though the object in hand were physically made up of hours from the lives of others. And the idea that an hour of life itself can be estranged from an individual and sold for monetary compensation is also something Marx thinks through seriously, though too much to talk about here.

My second point though, that people use toothpaste everyday, has to do with the thinking of another philosopher I've been reading while studying for my oral exams - [Martin Heidegger](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/). Though he's interested [in his big work](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/#BeiTim) about ontological questions (like, what kind of being does the number 1 have vs. the color brown, a chair, the solar system, or my cat, etc) he also believes that things 'are' for humans (or *Dasein* in his terminology, the being for whom being is an issue or question) in a way that is more natural. In his thinking, when I see a desk, I don't go an abstract, philosophical, Aristotelian route and think of it as a substance with attributes (such as squareness or brownness), I think more of whether or not it is the right size, or close enough to a reading light, or if it is an heirloom that needs to be treated carefully. That these considerations actually make up, in many ways, the 'being' of the table itself for Dasein (humans) was fascinating to me when I first started reading.

Hence: toothpaste! I brush my teeth twice a day and use toothpaste from a tube that looks like one of these. Using a brand new tube is very different from the ones I have drawn here. I have had many experiences crumpling up tubes to try to make them last, to *extend their lives*, so to speak, by *using up* everything I can. The "time" of a tube of toothpaste, its lifespan, is relatively slow (or long) compared to, say, a quart of milk or loaf of bread. The same tube persists through many weeks of use, and there is even a certain feeling of 'letting go' and beginning again when I have to stop crushing up an old battered but familiar tube and go buy new.

This connects with another picture, those of time pieces.

I wanted to draw the things I look at most during the day to tell what time it is. When this Dasein thinks of time, he probably thinks first of the stuff he uses to 'tell the time'. For me these are my computer and my phone. My window into [Greenwich Mean Time](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/) is almost always small numbers on a screen that sometimes fail to update to Daylight Savings. A lot of people have watches though, so I wanted to draw one of them too.

Last is more abstract. I was thinking of Johanna Drucker's work in [Graphesis: Visual Forms of Knowledge Production](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674724938), and particularly an article she wrote for [DHQ](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/) called ("Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display")[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html] in which she gives some examples of how humanists can use graphical representations. So I decided to draw some graphs about how we might experience time in a 24-hour period. 

![Time graphs](/images/10.13graphs.JPG)

I was envisioning that a given person would travel along the path of the line, x-axis being each hour passing, and y-axis being... something else. Experience? Not sure - point being, although the same number of 'hours' passed for each, the length, trajectory, and experience of each line (or sets of lines) was very unique. Would love to draw some more of these, or at least think through them a little more seriously before the month is out.
