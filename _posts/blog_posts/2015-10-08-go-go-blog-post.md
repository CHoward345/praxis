So, I’ve been thinking about representing time. Let’s say, for instance, we want to represent the systematic, repeated demarkation of time, or the rhythm, of go-go music. For a basic overview of this genre, here’s the [wiki page] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-go)

Things I’ve been considering in relation to this:

* the beat can be written in standard notation (or TUBS, or any number of other sonic-writ-visual systems), but this is not how it would be distributed or written by people who play it, and it de-contextualizes the beat, removes it from all space and time
* de-contextualization via a written system or a recorded snippet seems a slippery slope, especially given the history of de-contextualizing and appropriating African American musical traditions
* film representations and national popularizations have varied views: [Washington City Paper Article] (http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/42532/da-oral-history-of-da-butt-put-your-memory-in/)
* if we can’t ethically represent the beat without including historical and culturally contextual information, how much historical and cultural info do we include? and what, exactly? An [amazing article on go-go] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/how-long-can-go-go-keep-going/2015/08/28/20e5bbb4-4b39-11e5-bfb9-9736d04fc8e4_story.html) that addresses social and cultural issues, oppression, decline, current-day status, etc.
* and then, obviously, what would this representation of rhythm of/in a certain place and time look/sound/feel like? Like [this]? (http://www.culturalequity.org/lomaxgeo/)
* an audience member, DJ, record collector, etc. can be as much a part of a scene as the musicians playing the music— do we represent them? how?

Some broader questions I’m thinking about:

* How do we sensitively, empathetically represent things that are experiential? or aurally relayed? or performative parts of a culture? you kind of can’t just throw the performance (audio/visual/script/sheet music) up there and say “here it is!” … or can you?
* Music and soundscapes in digital sound archives is fun, satisfies a great curiosity and allows self-directed learning. What are the drawbacks?
* How do we define the parameters of representation? By anticipated use? How can we perceive this?

So I’m trying to imagine a representation of a musical use of time that is of a certain time. Reflecting on it today will cause us to represent it a certain way, though a modern lens. Prototype idea 1 — an annotated map of the area that was ground zero for go-go venues with information from the perspective of a performer, dancer, fan, with video, aural explanation of the beat, and why it is significant to the cultural and historical legacy of the community. Essentially, a richly annotated and interactive snapshot from the heyday of the genre.
Prototype idea 2 — a game where you physically learn the go-go beat, and the better you perform (play in time! make it groove!) the more cultural and historical information you are given.

Just some things I’m thinking about in relation to time and its varied meanings, representations, and uses.
