Javascript run through - some examples...

//string
var name = "Scott";
//number
var number = 4;
//if else
if (number === 4) {
console.log(name);
} esle {
console.log("Not 4");
}

things to remember ** JS uses camelCaseWords
** functions = abstract, break down into smaller pieces

var addition = function ( x,y ) {
return x + y;
}
var sum = addition (5,8);
console.log(sum);

var names = ['cat','dog'];          (this is an array, which is compartmentalized info)

-historical info on bits, how computers work (0, 1 / off, on) so don't get annoyed if codes don't work, it's dodo brain in some ways

Next week - complete through unit 4 on code academy and be prepared to talk about personal tracking
