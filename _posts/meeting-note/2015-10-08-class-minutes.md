As an ongoing experiment in digital documents, James P. Ascher took these notes
during the October 8, 2015 Praxis class meeting. He used the [org-mode](http://orgmode.org)
of [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). The file is
available as the original org file:
[2015-10-8-class-minutes.org](/images/code/2015-10-8-class-minutes.org).

[Eric Rochester](http://scholarslab.org/people/eric-rochester/) helped
convert the org file into Markdown using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org)
which is pasted below. The .org file includes more structure and
metadata than the below, which we might learn how to convert too, on day.

Case studies
============

B: we were still hashing things out<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Bremen"></span>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

J: posted a memo of his case study<span class="tag" data-tag-name="James"></span>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

S: reading more about time perception and people with terminal illnesses, "entering a world with no future"<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Scott"></span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Three conclusions: no future, no ability to plan, disjunction between planning with friends while healthy<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Scott"></span>

### many didn't want information about the prognosis, but the sense of the lack of future remained<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Scott"></span>

### friends remained future oriented, so they felt outside of time, no idea how much longer they'll last<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Scott"></span>

#### Discussion

#### La: nurse for oncology, everything rings true to her experience<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Laura"></span>

#### A: children function like this too, and "a sec" is very confusing to them because it's not a second, but could be 20 minutes which feels longer for children<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Ammon"></span>

#### S: they only talked to people over 18 in the study; A: Alzheimer's?<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Scott"></span><span class="tag" data-tag-name="Ammon"></span>

### talking about caregivers, asking for help: felt like **taking time** from someone else, so if people **gave time** it felt more comfortable for the patient<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Scott"></span>

### S: asking about the gift and the philosophy of the gift; but the language seems to be one of the *economics of affect*<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Scott"></span>

#### P: we're future oriented, so being terminally ill crystallizes: time shifts from a vague possibility to something that **IS**<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Purdom"></span>

#### B: thinking about policing, parallel: time as trust; how people understand their obligations to others; connects to S in feeling out of time with others, with a chronic instability of life it becomes complicated and important for representation; can we understand how people are in time<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Bremen"></span>

#### S: compare people with term. ill with people in prison: "imprisoned by the illness" or "Locked in"; monasteries might connect to imprisoned people<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Scott"></span>

#### P: when someone is ill in the hospital, there is so much alone time in a room<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Purdom"></span>

#### La: "literally an 8 year old and they are in a room smaller than this for 45 days" the kind only has a few visitors; being specific about the time on the clock because "she is aware of how precious those moments are" and wants to help make time pass faster for the kids; teenagers are more difficult because they need entertainment<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Laura"></span>

#### S: is the order and structure the same?<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Scott"></span>

#### La: various things can impact the day, one can hope to have it consistent, but may-or-may-not be<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Laura"></span>

#### S: **icon set** set of small drawings for regular events throughout the day to be oriented, you can see the structure of the day; make an icon set for a normal person and look for repetitions, do the same for different types of illnesses; is it still repetition or pure chaos?<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Scott"></span>

#### Er: tying in several comment: medieval- 2 groups occupied: younger nobility or minor English King who retired; different conceptions of time- same as nurses and teachers and different people; the icon set may also communicate between teachers and students; different groups occupying the same space<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Eric"></span>

Ly: "Towards an Ecology of Time..." will post, broadly about music as a way to bind us into time;<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Lydia"></span>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### rhythm is what binds us; categorizes sounds to give a rhythm;<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Lydia"></span>

### Bachelor (?) philosopher: social cohesion is people able to think at the same time;<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Lydia"></span>

### when something is out of time or out of tune; we enact agency by choosing how to cohabitate in time;<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Lydia"></span>

### grandmother had cancer, but was not told because it was inoperable and she didn't want to know; she knew something was wrong, but never **knew**;<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Lydia"></span>

### there is a way that time is shortened or prolonged by awareness of illness<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Lydia"></span>

#### Discussion

#### G: aunt had pain and it turned out she had cancer; once it became clear her body couldn't handle it, she went right into hospice<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Gillete"></span>

#### A: mother's passing, she felt that she had way-extended her time already<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Ammon"></span>

#### P: understandings of time while others are dying around you connects to B's topic of crisis time; really little when AIDS hit Jacksonville, many men died very quickly, not much effect on them as children, but mother has a different relationship to time<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Purdom"></span>

#### A: grandparents 80s and 90s, amazed at they are still alive and enjoying it in contrast to those who are waiting<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Ammon"></span>

#### G: All the King's Men: time is a force that operates of its own accord- an active and literal force; A: a gravity?; G: yeah, pushing down on you<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Gillete"></span>

#### P: embodied time versus time as an external force<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Purdom"></span>

#### S: clocks are interesting because they are an external measure of time, but if you actually perceive it in a radically different way; technologies of objective time can be so affectively changed that they are no longer objective time keepers<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Scott"></span>

#### G: what do drugs do to time? e.g. once on "dilotin" time went fast<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Gillete"></span>

#### P: on morphine, timed with the Price is Right: he wanted colors to meditate on?<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Purdom"></span>

#### La: some people feel like illness is an attack on their time because the kid is sick, others support; 10 year olds don't have a concept of death; proactive families vs. embittered families: that week can feel very differently given the emotional aspect; some families are demanding, others wait patiently, but changes how time feels<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Laura"></span>

#### B: resilience and response to a brain aneurysm; she responded well and it effected the progression of the illness; **resilience** seems to be a key term<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Bremen"></span>

J: some nonsense on note-taking; observes that it can show someone's point of view in a profound way<span class="tag" data-tag-name="James"></span>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ly: horrified that someone will see notes after someone's death; people will go through stuff after death, she'll be bugged; she hides books with marginalia because she's worried people will know how her brain works; other professors will share notes<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Lydia"></span>

### P: mark of a person in time: notes in books; some people are good personal-archivists; Salman Rushdie's computers, did a case study about his papers, became very intimate with how his brain worked; what he remembered and what he forgot about: revealed so much of his system of thought; the notes become a **pace** in time and reviewing the notes people die again<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Purdom"></span>

### Et: notes persist way longer than the person does; anticipation is part of them; Kafka, he's like not going to burn everything- nothing he can do; "**the future is really public**"<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Ethan"></span>

### P: **Immortality**: Beethoven is trying to form his own, but in conflict with; oh wait it's Goethe, but his love interest has a different interest; follows into the afterlife and Goethe picks a different representation<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Purdom"></span>

### B: ethnography about Young People in Philadelphia running from the law **On the Run**; G: wants to talk about it with B; really controversial as to whether or not it's true; all the ways that people destroy their archives to avoid the law; ways that people are forced to lie to loved ones to protect them; material stuff becomes really important in the way that relationships are maintained; "**the future is very public**"<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Bremen"></span><span class="tag" data-tag-name="Gillete"></span>

Et: objects and how we consume things in his drawings--orals!--brought in Marx **Capital** specific technical definition of labor time: value of commodity produced by this labor time, as exchange values all commodities are "definite quantities of congealed labor time"<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Ethan"></span>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### J: labor time congealed into ethics<span class="tag" data-tag-name="James"></span>

### Et: limits of thinking about commodities this way; a jar of peanut butter, so many hours of work; what are the limits of E's labor<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Ethan"></span>

### Ly: labor time buys stuff and labor time makes stuff, it's hard to trace; capitalism in music, cost \$0.99, what is the labor that went into this; a mass market system hides this; what are you buying?<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Lydia"></span>

### G: thinking of people as commodities- how does labor go into that? enslavement? athletes? putting in labor time and getting so much less out of it; how does that work when its people? Or when people are being exploited?<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Gillete"></span>

### B: efficiency experiments, time-motion studies; how workers relate<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Bremen"></span>

### La: looking at wrongful death suits, younger people are viewed as more valuable commodity; families get more money in wrongful death for younger people<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Laura"></span>

### G: slavery in America, people were valued very highly as was their labor; the enslavers wouldn't represent that to the person who was enslaved; if someone got injured<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Gillete"></span>

### La: language of worth and value becomes conflicted in this occasion of slavery<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Laura"></span>

### P: difficult article on doctors who are physicians to enslaved peoples... posting if possible?; more likely for a blacksmith, but less likely for a child; grappling with **worth** vs. **value**<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Purdom"></span>

### G: more concerned as we get closer to the civil war, they become more valuable<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Gillete"></span>

### TODO Ly: will blog?: Lomax Archives online, recording in the 1920s of people around the world; recording African American men in prisons, songs available online for free; copyright owned by Lomax family, the slaves aren't even named (prison laborers?); there's another archive of the Lomax notes, of its time, but doesn't get the creators of the songs; copyright is meant to privilege the author: systematic flaw; commodification of actual labor; J: ethical audits of archives; Ly: look at Lomax? fun to fiddle with, but might not be ethical- ethics of a database, commodity, enslavement, Marxist<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Lydia"></span>

G: congealed labor and experiences: going to a fair- ride a Ferris wheel, what goes on to make that happen? time to set the fair up? what were people paid before you arrived? what is the value relation<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Gillete"></span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### S: Hardt and Negri model in **Empire** movement from industrial to production of affect; their example is flight-attendants: you use the right smile and manners, that's what you're paid for; harnessing of your own emotional and physical being; carnival or the fair: what are the actual labor practices that go into it; Disney employees are docked for being glum<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Scott"></span>

### P: everyone in the park has to be a "imagineer" which is documented in a book, there exists an underground path of space out of time in Disney world; you don't have to follow protocol<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Purdom"></span>

### TODO G: article about Williamsburg, will find and post; B: who wrote it? was it a prof here?; G: Marlon Ross made me read it; P: would love to read it<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Gillete"></span>

### P: lord mayor of the Renaissance fair, lord mayor toad, trying to connect with the kid; representation at the fair- how it's strange; **dino time**<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Purdom"></span>

### Ly: it's like Futurama the 90s people look like 20s people<span class="tag" data-tag-name="Lydia"></span>
