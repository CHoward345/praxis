narrow down what we’re actually working on
3 areas, case studies?
end of semester portfolio of representations of time from case studies
lists from last week>priorities
-
james; what unites varieties of interests
	invisible girdle
song beat on, beat off
PUT GIRDLE ON, PUT GIRDLE OFF
D3 as tool (neatline too: land and chronology)
RDT: multiple girdles?
Jerm: metaphor of the invisible girdle explanation
Lydia: Go-Go as case study
Jerm & Scott: wouldn’t be invisible if you wanted people to find it
Scott: “great idea, now it’s just what you would do with it” D3 seems natural
Ethan: invisible v. unseeable (right in front of you, but can’t ‘make it count’)
James: Gossamer girdle?
Rachel: Gridle v. corset
GOGO as first case study?
Gillette: Likes GOGO because of space on u-street possibilities
Lydia: Things are still happening
Purdom: We’d need an IRB
RDT: What’s IRB
Other case studies?
Ethan: Scott’s embodied time studies – diabetes especially.
Purdom: Can we mark time in our own lives in a similar way?
Scott: Mark how we mark our own lives, habits, how are our lives structured, informed by them
Gillette: We did this according to gender for a class, it was helpful
Scott: Code factors of your life.
James: add third thing
Gogo, personal time,
And then…
Cybernetics, human mechanical machine,
Invisible girdles and cybernetics
Treating software as a diff-abled friend, can only think in certain parameters
	“what if, also>case studies, message transmissions with cybernetics, with different actors
Ethan explains James: how our experience of time is mediated with technology
Gillette: Weird to put “disease” on us
Lydia: Map tomagachi onto monastic life
Scott: Make reasonable expectations to use your time planning projects. Be good with deadlines.
Ethan: How we value time? Living under capitalism. I’ve been thinking about stuff
Lydia & Rachel: Money, spending habits relative to money

Scott:  everyone come up for most interesting single week tracking habit
