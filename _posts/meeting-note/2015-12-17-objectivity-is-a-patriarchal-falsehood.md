Objectivity is a patriarchal falsehood.

What to do next term?

Changes—flickering b/w pictures—either using objective C or swift (James wants to do Objective C)—wants to do this as tool for time
..* —apparently you can do this in Javascript, too

What are advantages of one larger project than smaller?
..* RDT: getting in deeper
..* -More collaborative; stronger project mgmt aspect—tho ends up being each person has a particular role
..* -Have to be careful with scoping on larger project—could be 2-3 different ways of visualizing w/varied contexts
..* Smaller projects—multiple ways of visualizing time, could explore them  
..* Smaller projects—have to do a little bit of everything

Are there advantages to show the work that we’ve done to communities including Uva, DH, etc.?
..*What reads as us having done something that we can show?*

Need to discuss budget, dissemination, and sustainability

First meeting back—scope out project, make general estimates about timing for each piece
..* Think over break what will benefit you long term, and what you want out of praxis

Rachel makes strong case for sound/sonification in addition to visualization

Is there a unifying thing to tie together multiple projects—or a thematic framing? Or would we do things individually?
..* —If we did something w/overarching narrative to have that inform dvlpmt of the tool and spend a little time abstracting the tool out of the context so that other people could use
          ..* —Or a potential note on here’s how we did this—framework and dialogue about work we did..

JPA: need to listen to each other—proposes speculative white papering

Purdom: speculative white papering as blog post
..* —Need to be more committed to scholarship in public
..* —Work in progress publicly—speculative pieces, concise, make transparent moment in which we’re working

Jeremy: Call for response/Request for comments—blog posts = RFCs in some ways
..* -How do we be better about commenting on each other’s blogs—is there something we could do to get more comments from people w/in and outside slab—maybe change the interface?

Stuff to do over break:
..* —personal website for ourselves
..* —work on D3
..* —Javascript, CSS, HTML tutorials
..* —Keep sketching
..* —speculative briefs blog post—your fantasy for a project; what it would be if you were doing it alone (not required—maybe more for after break as we get going)

Marking up CV = good way to learn html

James is giving everyone money??

Can make your site private—don’t need to publish

Talking about social presence first meeting maybe?
