So I've been thinking a lot about who tells history--or in other words who gets to determine what the passage of time means--and the relationship between time and justice/oppression. Who gets to have a history and therefore a claim to past time. What's the relationship between the past, the present, the future, and the telling of history. How does time relate to past/present/future? Questions I'm thinking of with these sketches.
