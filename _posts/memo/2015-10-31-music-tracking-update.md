I tracked my music consumption and exposure for a day. As I kind of suspected (but didn't want to believe), it's too big of a task. Brainstorming a new week long time project. Here's my data...

* 9:30-10:30am- Krishna Das music played at yoga class
* 10:45am- Staunton Coffee for a minute, weird 1970s horror movie soundtrack-y stuff
* 1:12pm- watched/listened to a video clip of GTBB on Facebook
* 2:50pm-3:15pm- Spotify "New Music Friday" (mainstream pop)
* 4ish- Sara Bareilles at Cranberry's (another coffee shop)
* 7-8:30ish- whatever Black Swan (book & record store) was playing before the Hypnagogia Film Collective show. Then the films had soundtracks (mostly glitchy, industrial compositions, and some noise art juxtaposed with the visual of a gospel album (!). So, this is where it gets tricky.
* 9-11pm- so much classic country you can't shake a stick at it, live at Marino's
* 11pm- whatever adult contemporary they were playing at Martin's (grocery store)

It's fun to see my day divided by music and genre and places, but it's hard to remember to do it, and it's weird and rude at times to make notes on my phone while I'm trying to talk to people or watch a film. Also, there just isn't the time to ask about every bit of music in a series of short films, or at a coffee shop playing an obscure record. And sometimes I totally forgot I was doing this (grocery store).

New week activity. Processing.
