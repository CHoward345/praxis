Heeeey errybody! For our week-long time-tracking endeavor I will be tracking the amount of time that I spend outside. I struggle pretty mightily with seasonal affective disorder; now that we have fallen back, so to speak, I think it will be useful for me to soak up the Vitamin D and whatnot. So that is what I am going to track. I'm interested in seeing how being more mindful about my time outside impacts how I experience time throughout the rest of the day. So, here goes! See y'all in a week!
