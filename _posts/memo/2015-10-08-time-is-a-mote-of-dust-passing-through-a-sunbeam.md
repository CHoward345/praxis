What if right now is just as fleeting as a mote of dust passing through a sunbeam. 

When I was a kid, I would lye on the floor and watch dust float through the
sunbeams that streamed through the window. (I grew up in Arizona, so I could do
this any day of the year.)

I tried to depict this in this drawing (with some elephants of course).

Trying to think about different ways of of imagining time. 

The sunbeam, the light streaming through the window, and the motes of dust can
represent several things: 

1. Individual awareness. The beam of light is what an individual is aware of,
   and the motes of dust are memories, they float in and out of conciousness.

2. Global, societal awareness. The beam of light is what society is aware of,
   the global conciousness, and the motes are events, cultural tropes, etc.

3. Sunbeam as "now". Looking at the sunbeam we see what is happening now. The
   dust particles are people, or places or things existing in the moment, only
   to pass through "now". The darkness would be memory.
