What if our prototype is impermanent? Or decays, changes, evolves over time. Some readings about rhythm took me to Bas Jansen's essay "Tape Cassettes and Former Selves: How Mix Tapes Mediate Memories" and Jonathan Sterne's "The Preservation Paradox in Digital Audio."
I have fond memories of crafting mix tapes, as well as mix CDs. Agonizing over songs (and sometimes clips of Ralph Wiggum or Bruno S.) that would be accessible to the listener I was targeting and embed whatever message I just had to relay.

But I created them knowing they wouldn't last forever. As Sterne notes, "the vast majority of recordings in history are lost."

Tapes get stuck in players, unspool, are taped over, are overused. CDs gets scratched, tossed out after being imported, left in junked cars. Both are made obsolete by iPods, iPhones, then Spotify.

Do we need to make something that captures time and resists it? Is that the goal? That embraces time? How? That allows others to mark time? That has an expiration date? That decays, evolves, changes with time? We could provide people with mixes, or we could provide people with blank tapes.
