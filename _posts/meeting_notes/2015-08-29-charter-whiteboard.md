These notes were taken at the first 2015 Praxis meeting (August 27
from 9 AM till 10:30 pm) in blue dry-erase marker on three whiteboards
in a total of four columns. Ronda wrote them on the board based on the
discussion including Eric, Scott, Ammon, Rachel, Bremen, Lydia,
Purdom, Gillet, Jeremy, Wayne, Ethan, and James. Transcription is
based on digital photos provided by Purdom. Typos are silently
corrected and line-breaks that seem to bear semantic meaning are
transcribed with a pipe "|" or as line-breaks, but otherwise
suppressed. All insertions on the white-board were indicated with an
arrow, unless otherwise noted in the transcription. When transcribing
for the website, underlines indicating emphasis are replaced with
**bold** word because Markdown does not support underline, longer
dashes are `&mdash;` rather than two hyphens, and the sub-list under
"How we present ourselves to others" is represented as quotes.

##Transcription

Assumption of good intent [*rest of line inserted*] personal
accountability that this is true for you

The whole person matters & needs to be cared for.

Compassion for self **and** others.

Mutual respect (people & ideas) agreement **and** disagreement

Being excited when someone is discovering the new (Welcoming the 10,000)

Generosity [*rest of line inserted*] of inquiry &mdash; academic empathy
(meeting people where they are)

Listening

Asking questions &mdash; responsiveness | deep engagement w/ others ideas

Power of generative play | not taking things too seriously |
recognizing that what appears unproductive can generate breakthroughs

Consent matters

Flow -

Awareness that language can be slippery | "Ted talking" &mdash;
boiling down complex to simple

Criticism comes w/ offer of collaboration [*rest of line inserted*]
offer possibilities, not solution

Accessibility

Patience &mdash; w/ people + ideas "Yes, and..."

Laughter -

Fluidity &mdash; path not a destination

Iteration + reflection

personal failure &mdash; mindfulness of how we are w/ each other

technical failure &mdash; people have different tolerances + needs

Assessing [*next three words inserted*] successes **and** failures
where we are and where we're going continually

Boundaries & edges will keep cropping up

Feedback &mdash; have different needs, meet them where they are

Sympathy [*next six words* (being ... accessibility) *inserted*] being
deliberate w/ compassion, criticism, accessibility for those "outside
the circle"

Balancing group and individual &mdash; taking care of both sides matters

Be aware of the context our work might play into

How we present ourselves to others

>What are the groups?

>>departments

>>colleges + universities

>>C'ville

>>any group @ a talk or event &mdash; community of interest

>>awareness [*next word inserted*] empathy of ways of being, pressures
>of being for other races, gender identities, sexual orientations

>>[*rest of line in the next column*] research partners

Credit : acknowledging we're building on the work of others

Ok to profess ignorance about something
