This week I'm experimenting with literate programming and sanitizing
data sets in a way that is part of the argument. There are a few
technologies I needed to do this, but I'll let the post speak for
itself. If you have [Juypter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) installed
with the
[Javascript Kernel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ijavascript) you
should be able to download the notebook file itself and run it locally
to confirm my process.

- Notebook file:
[2015-11-16-regularizing-cloud-data.ipynb](/images/code/2015-11-16-regularizing-cloud-data.ipynb)
- Data file: [2015-11-16-cloud_data.csv](/images/code/2015-11-16-cloud_data.csv)

However, if you don't want to bother installing Jupyter and the
kernel, you should be able to see the file at this link, a rendering
service hosted by Rackspace:
