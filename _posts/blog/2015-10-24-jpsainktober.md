So, we've all been doing [Inktober](http://inktober.com) and I've
taken a while to get up to speed. It seems to me that Inktober is
aimed at "artists all over the world," not so much writers, or writers
of essays and dissertations. Many of my artist friends have worked
hard to perfect their art and Inktober seems like a chance for them to
show off their fabulous work. What have I been hard at work on that
deserves to even stand alongside their hard-won skills?

In early October, I visited the
[Fralin Museum of Art](http://www.virginia.edu/artmuseum/index.php)
and saw some of their selection of the *I GOT UP* conceptual art of On
Kawara which struck a chord with me (sadly, they didn't allow
photography, but they're pretty similar to the
[work that the Metropolitan Museum of Art has posted](http://metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2001.228a-pp).)
What struck me about Kawara's conceptual art was that it was art in
the doing, not in the singular action. He produced a process that
of writing and mailing postcards all around the world, stopping only
when his stamp was stolen. If it's about nothing else, Inktober is
about commitment to process and On Kawara seemed like as good an
emblem as any.

Ten years ago in October, I was at the University of Florida in my
last year of coursework and taking notes for my classes. My
handwriting had always been atrocious and I often couldn't read my own
notes, so I decided to improve it.  My friend Justin Smith and I had
spent the summer leaning a running italic hand from a copy of Ludovico
Vicentio degli Arrighi's *La Operina* that we had found in facsimile
(we had to stumble through with an Italian dictionary in hand, but you can find a
[free translated version online](http://www.operina.com) which is
quite nice.) By October 10th, my handwriting had greatly improved even
though my notes looked a bit silly:

It seems to me that this Inktober was a great time for me to practice
writing, thinking about time, and coding metadata. Starting with just
ruling some lines to guide my writing with a bone folder and
straight-edge, I began by writing the date:

![Oct 11, 2015](/images/inktober/2015-10-11-jpaink.jpg)

The horizontal rules from the previous page had pushed through to the
next, which saved me time as I could line the ruler up on these
previous lines. However, I didn't like how October 11th was too far to
the left, so I measured the width of the date, the width of the page,
and ruled two more lines to make it centered:

![Oct 12, 2015](/images/inktober/2015-10-12-jpaink.jpg)

I kept up this procedure, varying the ruled but uninked lines&mdash;which
carried through the paper to the next day&mdash;and trying to perfect a
sort of graphic representation of the date. Looking back, I think by
October 16th I had achieved a stable clarity:

![Oct 16, 2015](/images/inktober/2015-10-16-jpaink.jpg)

Which, of course, meant that on October 17th I slipped into an
artistic period of decadence. You can almost hear some sort of
Halloween plastic faux-skull laughing through these letters with their
wildly and unnecessarily curving serifs:

![Oct 17, 2015](/images/inktober/2015-10-17-jpaink.jpg)

I needed something new and as we've been thinking about how time can
be granular in different ways, I thought about the fact I was writing
the day, but not the time. The drawing didn't occur all day, it
happened within a specific set of minutes at some point in the day, so
giving it only a date seemed somehow disingenuous. I took the lines that
were carrying through from the previous day and spent several days
perfecting a layout for for the date *and* time. By October 20th I had
gotten my system of ruling down and was satisfied with the layout:

![Oct 20, 2015](/images/inktober/2015-10-20-jparuling.jpg)

My date and time from that day seems to be the clearest that I
produced with that template, a smidgen of fancy in the five, but
otherwise restrained and clear:

![Oct 20, 2015](/images/inktober/2015-10-20-jpaink.jpg)

Looking back, I can now see the pattern where after the moment of
clarity, I draw with decadence. October 21st was an attempt to capture
the look of broken type on the '7' while keeping the rest of the page
as clear as possible:

Clearly, I needed a new challenge to keep going. Since this was my
second time writing away from my desk at home, I figured I'd start to
record the location where I did the drawing as well. I've not yet hit
another moment of clarity yet: the location isn't centered and
looks too big, but I am pleased enough with the direction
I'm headed that I've taken to posting my images to Instagram where
strangers have begun flagging them with likes:

## The Invisible Girdle as Layout ##

In our meetings, we've been talking about the concept of the
"invisible girdle," (coined by
[Rachel Trapp](http://scholarslab.org/people/rachel-devorah-trapp/) as
a better version of "invisible corset" which described a series of
invisible nodes and edges I was trying to use in my
[Graphviz visualizations of time](/memo/2015/10/07/on-graphviz/) to
force the graph into a particular layout; Ethan Reed has suggested
that "invisible" might not even be the right word and he's undoubtedly
posted on that by now) by which we mean both cultural and political
constraints on how time functions. Our literature is girdled into
centuries, nations, and languages; our parts of town are girdled into
commercial, green space, car space, and bike space. Girdling is always
suspect, though not always necessarily bad. There is a connection to
Go-go dancing in Washington D.C. which
[Gillet has recently written about](/memo/2015/10/21/building-time/)
as well as [Lydia in a previous post.](/blog/2015/10/08/go-go-blog-post/)

interest in the invisible girdle is that it is also a good metaphor
for the process of layout and the history of body techniques. In the
Inktober drawings above, my ruled lines form a sort of invisible
girdle for unruled letters that extend to, and sometimes beyond, the
girdle but are *roughly* kept in place. So, at a particular moment
in time, the ruled lines create the layout for the drawing. However,
the lines are carried forward from day to day.

When I rule October 25th, there will be the faint traces of the rules
from October 24th that will help guide me in laying out the
lines. This happens because my notebook is in codex form so when I
rule one page, the effect of that ruling extends to the page below as
well and someone even to the next page. The soft touch of a fountain
pen on suitably sized paper doesn't carry to the next page, but the
*pressure* from my ruling does. For the way I'm thinking about the
invisible girdle, this is a productive metaphor. An earlier girdle
sets-up the condition for the today's and even when you want to alter
the layout, you cannot stray too far without obviously coloring outside
of the lines. An invisible girdle from today, one from yesterday, and
perhaps one even further back, constrains my unruly handwriting.

Cascading Style-Sheets and more modern internet layout technology
build on this long history of layout as girdle. When we update the
margins, the padding, the border, etc. of how an element will display
on a page it gives it space to expand is some ways and constrains it
in others. When we look to a technology like
[d3.js](http://d3js.org/), we see *data driven* documents, that is the
data flows into the document's layout. When we program for d3.js, we
decide on the girdle that some&mdash;perhaps unknown&mdash;collection of
data will fit into.

Yet, these technologies hail their earlier incarnations in the same way that
the ruling from one page of my notebook passes to another. Jaron Lanier reminds us in
[*You Are Not a Gadget*](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2010/01/the_geek_freaks.html)
that internet technologies are the hack that suited a particular time
petrified into an inherited practice. His example of MIDI as standard
for data transmission, but profoundly tied to 80s keyboard synths,
shows how our new technologies often have bits of the old within
them.

As I write this in Emacs,
[a text-editor that chronologically could be my older brother](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/),
I think about how what we can do today is constrained by what we knew
how to do yesterday. Yesterday's limitations in Internet Explorer,
limit HTML, which in turn limits the development of CSS, and constrain
how we think webpages should look. It as though the past is present
especially prominently in the hidden code of the
most forward-moving technologies. Marcel Mauss
explored a similar idea with body techniques, observing that the 1902
*Encyclopedia Britannica* described a way of swimming that few people
continued to practice. We learn body techniques by mimicking the
previous generation and so they change, but slowly. Different times
and nations have different body techniques, but new ones can't move
far from where we are now.

Our digital invisible girdles that constrain not only what things
*can* look like, but what we think they *should* look like, are a
chaotic kludge hacked together from partially remembered pieces of the
past. Ten years ago, I began to use italic handwriting for my notes to
store information; naturally, today I turn to that same technique when
asked to draw in ink.
