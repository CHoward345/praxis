# Praxis Schedule 2017-2018

Note: this is a draft schedule. The speakers listed below represent only possibilities - no one has been approached, and no one has these events on their calendar. This should probably be clear, given that many of the weeks do not have session leaders just yet.

Praxis meets for two hours once a week during the academic year. The following schedule represents a projection of what the content of those weekly meetings will be. Each session is projected to be roughly 90 minutes long, which will allow plenty of time for flexibility and conversation with the group before and after.
