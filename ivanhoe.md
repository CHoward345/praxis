challenges with Ivanhoe:

update system/alert to remind you to play the game, real time,
responsive update system
hard to remember as response takes you to a new page, perhaps split
screen or some way of being able to reference the move one was
responding to
respond to more than one move at once (already sort of set up)
ways of editing moves
isolated to the individual rather than returning to the collective

taking turns? verses all at once--timeline can get wonky

boost move via twitter? like wordpress 


make it pretty

--
liked: fun, research and background gathering than anticipated, exercise
in creativity, power to take on another persepective, subverts assumed
meaning, draw attention to things worthy of being pointed to, no real
heirarchy to opening move to response, flexible to use in a variety of
contexts


examples of use cases
examples targeted at particular groups of users
ways of movitivating ppl to be interested in game (subject, way of play,
notification of others seeing what you have done, consolidated play
space, active eleemnts within page, see different sides of ppl i know,
audience = intimate, not broad)

-wordpress as Ivanhoe game, plugins as moves

play games for 30 minutes
-Family Reunion
-Exquisit corpse (collaborative storytelling--individual and collective)
